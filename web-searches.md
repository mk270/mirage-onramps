The following remarks are edited versions of things people said in
a broader discussion about on-ramps

The Mirage tutorial is very linear but that's Ok. It is too long for

It is even difficult to find appropriate tutorials about OCaml on the
OCaml website

I found a 33 part video on youtube. It claimed to be the first english
language video tutorial; after the first dozen five-minute videos, I was
able to get going by myself
